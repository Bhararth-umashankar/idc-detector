					<h1>Breast Cancer Detector</h1>
					<p>Cancer might just be one of the most feared and dreaded diseases. Globally, cancer is responsible for the death of nearly 9.5 million people in 2018. It is the second leading cause of death as per the world health organization. We provide help and inspire hope to those affected by breast cancer through early detection, education, and support services.</p>

					<h2>A General Directive</h2>
					<p>In order to detect breast cancer using our model on this site, a tissue section is to be put on a glass slide which is further examined by a pathologist under a microscope. The pathologist then needs to visually scan large regions where there is no cancer in order to ultimately find malignant areas.Futhermore, these glass slides can now be digitized and wise use of computer vision can be used to speed up a pathologist's workflow and provide diagnosis support. By deploying a machine learning solution as a web application,the team aims to provide an efficient and free use of this model to medical personnels across the globe.</p>
