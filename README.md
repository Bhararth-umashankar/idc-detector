Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide accounting for 25 percent of all cancer cases. As a solution, machine learning techniques can dramatically improves the accuracy of diagnosis. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common subtype of all breast cancers. To assign an aggressiveness grade to a whole mount sample, pathologists typically focus on the regions which contain the IDC. The aim of this project is to teach the machine how to classify images and tell us if it is malignant or benign without any human intervention and at a much quicker speed with greater accuracy.
